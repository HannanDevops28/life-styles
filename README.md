## Features

- **Random User Fetching** â€“ integrates with [randomuser.me API](https://randomuser.me).
- **Search (Client-side Filtering)** â€“ search by **name, email, or location** within the currently loaded users.
  - Instant UI updates.
  - Limited to loaded results because the API does **not** support `?search` queries.
- **Filter by Gender** â€“ fetch only male or female users using API filters.
- **Pagination** â€“ move across pages of user results.
- **User Preview Modal** â€“ view profile picture, email, and location in a pop-up modal.
- **Google Maps Integration** â€“ visualize user locations on an interactive map powered by **Google Maps API**.
- **Local Storage Persistence** â€“ search term, filters, and current page are saved for session continuity.
- **Responsive UI** â€“ mobile-friendly layouts using Tailwind CSS.

## Search Functionality

- Currently implemented as **client-side filtering**:
  - App fetches a batch of users â†’ applies filter locally â†’ renders updated list.
- For **server-side search**:
  - Normally youâ€™d call an API endpoint with `?search=keyword`.
  - Since **randomuser.me doesnâ€™t support this**, client-side filtering was chosen.
  - In production with a custom API, server-side search could replace the filter.
